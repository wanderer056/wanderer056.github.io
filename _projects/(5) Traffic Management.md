description: A 2D traffic simulation built in Godot 4, featuring a four-way intersection with vehicles of different speeds and behaviors. Vehicles follow traffic lights and choose their own directions, while pedestrians cross the road at designated points. If a pedestrian is hit, an ambulance arrives to respond. The simulation is designed to explore traffic dynamics and learn how to implement real-time systems in Godot.

# Virtual WhiteBoard

The Virtual Whiteboard is a deep learning application using LSTM and OpenCV that enables users to draw and doodle using hand gestures detected by the front camera. It offers an intuitive, hands-free platform for visual explanations

In the **Virtual Whiteboard** program, you can activate the doodling feature by pressing the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + H`. This triggers an overlay on the current screen, activating the front camera for hand gesture recognition. Once enabled, you can seamlessly doodle on the screen using just your hands, providing a hands-free and intuitive way to create drawings and illustrations in real time.
